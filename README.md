# School-time-notification
An app made for students which creates a premanent notification while the user is in school, to tell the user how much time is left of the current break or period that the user is in.
Made to make time management at school easier but be please careful don't keep constatnly checking your phone.
At the moment only the timetable of my school is implemented but I am planning to make it customizeable in the future.
